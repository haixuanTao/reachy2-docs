## WiFi

On your first connection to a network, the simpliest is to connect your robot with an ethernet cable.  

If you cannot do this:

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable has to be plugged in port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.

We use `tio`for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
`apt install tio`

To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code> <br>Then reboot your computer for the new group to be effective." >}}

Then, in a terminal on your computer, get access to the robot with:

```python
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```

> Note that the connection could be on another USB port. Check all ports with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`

Manually connect the robot to a WiFi with:
```bash
nmcli device wifi connect <wifi.name> password <your.password>
```

> For example, with the wifi *POLLEN-WIFI*, with password *superstrongpassword*:  
> `nmcli device wifi connect POLLEN-WIFI password superstrongpassword`
