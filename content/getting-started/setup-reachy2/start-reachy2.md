## Power up your robot
To start your robot: 
1. Press the mobile base button (next to the mobile base's LCD screen). The mobile base's screen should turn on, indicating the current state of the battery (remaining battery percentage, current flow, etc).

2. **Automatic calibration process**

Put the robot in a environment with no obstacle, and make sure its arms or grippers are not touching the tripod.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The robot is going to slightly move during the calibration. Do not touch the robot during the calibration, and make sure the arms will not meet any obstacle during their movements." >}}

Press and turn clockwise the emergency stop button to raise it. The automatic calibration process will start.  

> Do not move the robot until the services running on the computer are ready for use.

3. Turn on the robot's computer:
- plug the green connector to the computer. The computer should automatically turn on.

- if the computer was already plugged, use the (a) button to turn it on.

> We advise to unplug the computer after each use for power saving, because the USB ports are still consuming current when the computer is off.
