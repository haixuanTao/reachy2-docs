Motion sickness may occur using the VR teleoperation application.  

We added a few options you can activate to reduce motion sickness, giving you a fix point in your field of view, or avoid peripheral movements when moving with the robot.

You have access to these options in the ***transition room***.  

On the left of the mirror, open the **Settings** tab, and configure the motion sickness options before starting teleoperating the robot.

### Reticle
Display a reticle to give a fixed point in the field of view. By default, the reticle only appears when the mobile base is moving.  

*Option:*
- **Always display reticle**: always display the reticle, even if the mobile base is not moving.

### Navigation effects

- **No effect**
- **Tunneling**: when moving the mobile base, a black tunneling will appear in your peripheral vision and reduce your field of view
- **Reduced screen**: when moving the mobile base, the size of the image will be reduced to let you see an artificial horizon behind it.

*Option:*
- **Activate effect on demande only**: during teleoperation, press one of the joysticks to activate/deactivate the occurence of the selected effect.  

    If used with *tunneling*, deactivate the effect will disable the tunneling when moving the mobile base, activate it will let it appear automatically.  

    If used with *reduced screen*, activate or deactivate the effect will let you manually reduce the size of the image.
