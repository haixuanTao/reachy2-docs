## Launch the app

Once everything is installed, you can launch the application.  
First connect your headset to your computer and make sure it is ready for use.

> Meta Quest headset must be used with the link.

Then run the *Reachy2Teleoperation.exe* file from the previously unzipped folder to start the application.

## Find Reachy IP address

If you haven't unplugged it, the LCD screen connected in Reachy's back should be diplaying its IP address.

If the LCD screen is not working or is unplugged, check out the page [Find my IP section]({{< ref "help/system/find-my-ip" >}}) to learn other ways to get the IP address.

## Connect to the robot

Create a new robot entry in the menu with the IP address you previously found.  

Once the robot is created, select it and click on "**Connect**".  
You should then arrive in the *transition room* of the application.  

A message to allow the network access to the app may pop up, in this case **allow access**:

Make sure the connection is fine by checking the information displayed at the top of the mirror.  
You must see:
- a green text telling you "Connected to Reachy"
- the view of the robot displayed in miniature
- a good network connection
