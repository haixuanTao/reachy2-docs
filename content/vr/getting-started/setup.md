## Audio and microphone setup

To have a better experience within the VR, configure the audio of your headset from your **headset settings**.  

You should be able to speak through the robot and hear from it when you are in the *transition room*.  
Check both audio input and output are on, and set them to a correct value.

> On the Meta Quest 2 headset, we use the following parameters:  
> - **audio input**: 100%  
> - **audio ouput**: 65%


## Motion sickness options

Once in the *transition room*, you have options you can configure to help you avoid motion sickness.  

On the left of the mirror, open the **Settings** tab, and configure the motion sickness options before starting teleoperating the robot.
