Here are 4 different options to find out the IP address of your robot.  
> Make sure your robot has already been connected to a network before trying to get its IP address.


## LCD display screen

If you haven't unplugged it, the LCD screen connected in Reachy's back should be diplaying its IP address.

## Hard-wired connection

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable has to be plugged in port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.

We use `tio`for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
`apt install tio`

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Make sure <i>dialout</i> is in your groups, otherwise add it to your groups. To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code>" >}}

Once connected, open a terminal on your computer and run:
```python
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```
*Note that depending on the elements you connected to the robot, the port could be something else than ttyUSB0. Check other available serial ports with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`*

You should then be connected to Reachy's computer via serial port.  
You can find the IP address with:
```python
ifconfig
```

> In our case, Reachy 2's IP is *"192.168.86.56"*.

## Using the serial number

Find the serial number of your robot on its back, connect your computer on the same network as your robot, open a terminal and type:
```bash
ping <robot.serial.number>.local
```

>For example, if the serial number is reachy2-beta0003:
>```bash
>ping <reachy2-beta0003>.local
>```

## Using a smartphone

The **[Fing app](https://www.fing.com/products/fing-app)** let you scan IPs directly from your smartphone. 

To use it, install the app on your smartphone and connect your smartphone on the **same network** as the robot, then run an analysis of the network to find out the IPs connected. Reachy 2 must be one of them!
