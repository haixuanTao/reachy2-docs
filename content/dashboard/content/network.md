The wifi tab of the dashboard lets you handle the network connection of the robot.  
You can get the IP address and choose the network you want to connect the robot to.  

It looks like the following:

{{< img-center "images/dashboard/content/network.png" 600x "Wifi page" >}}

There are 2 main elements on this page:
1. **Network status card**: this card will display the current network connections of the robot and its IP addresses. You may have two IP addresses if your robot is both connected to wifi and ethernet,

2. **Update wifi card**: this card will help you connect Reachy to a wifi network. The dropdown will list each wifi network detected. Select the network you want to connect to and enter your wifi password in the corresponding box.
