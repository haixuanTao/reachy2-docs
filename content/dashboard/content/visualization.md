## Foxglove

Open a [Foxglove](https://foxglove.dev/) window to visualize data of the robot.  
It specially enables to visualize ROS data from the robot.

## VNC

Open a window to visualize graphical elements running on the robot.  

As [RViz](http://wiki.ros.org/rviz) is launched by default with the [reachy2-core service]({{< ref "/dashboard/content/services" >}}), you can see the Rviz window showing a simplified robot moving.
