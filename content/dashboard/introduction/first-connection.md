When you receive your Reachy, it can be quite confusing at first to get your hands on, that is where the dashboard comes handy.

## 1. Find Reachy 2's IP address

After you connected the robot to the network, it should have an IP address. You can find it on the LCD screen in the robot's torso.  

In case the screen does not display the IP address, follow the instructions of [Find Reachy 2's IP]({{< ref "help/system/find-my-ip" >}}).

## 2. Connect from the navigator

From your computer, on the same network, open a navigator and go to:  
**`http://<IP.address>:8000/`** 

> For example, if the screen indicates `192.168.1.42`, connect to `http://192.168.1.42:8000/`
