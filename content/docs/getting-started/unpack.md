## Your robot is nearly already assembled!

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="The robot weigh is around 50kg (110lb). You will need to be at least 3 to carry the robot out of the box. </br>Wear suitable personal protective equipment (e.g. safety shoes) when unpacking the robot. When lifting Reachy 2, pay attention to lift correctly using with your legs, to avoid back injury. Be also aware of your fingers position on the robot." >}}

Unpack your robot, you just have a few things to plug to finish assembling it.  
Check your box contains, in addition to the robot, the following elements:
- a battery charger
- a calibration board
- wifi antennas
- a mini USB cable
- an emergency stop button
- robot antennas screws

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Make a visual check of all the robot to check nothing seems damage after the travel, especially the cables. In case of doubt on any element, please contact us. </br>Do not use the robot if something is damaged." >}}

## Adjust robot size

Reachy 2 is mounted on its mobile base with a tripod for stability.  

This tripod is **adjustable in height**: choose a suitable height before starting using the robot.  

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Be careful, Reachy 2 is heavy. Ask for help to adjust robot size." >}}

To do so, maintain the mobile base and ask for someone to maintain the robot's torso. Then unscrew all pods (do not unscrew them too much!), and raise the robot's torso.

> The button on the cranks are here to modify their positions without unscrewing them.

## Assemble the last elements

### Screw the robot antennas

Stick the antennas in the support on the head, then use the provided screws to fix them, preferably from the back hole. There is one screw by antenna.

Make sure to place them correctly so that the robot's arms cannot touch them:

### Plug the emergency stop button

To plug the emergency state button, you will find a little black connector on the mobile base. Simply connect the button cable to it.

First make sure the emergency stop button is pressed.  
Then plug the yellow connector of the mobile base so the robot will be powered when the emergency stop button will be unpressed.
