## Your robot is already assembled!

Simply unpack your robot, everything is already assembled and plugged.

### Screw the robot antennas

### Plug the WiFi antennas

Plug the antennas on the robot computer. Make sure to place them correctly so that the robot's arms cannot touch them:

### Plug the emergency stop button

To plug the emergency state button, you will find a little black connector on the mobile base. Simply connect the button cable to it.

## Adjust robot size

Reachy 2 is mounted on its mobile base with a tripod for stability.  

This tripod is **adjustable in height**: choose a suitable height before starting using the robot.  

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Be careful, Reachy 2 is quite heavy. Ask for help to adjust robot size." >}}

To do so, maintain the mobile base and ask for someone to maintain the robot's torso. Then unscrew all pods (do not unscrew them too much!), and raise the robot's torso.

> The button on the cranks are here to modify their positions without unscrewing them.
