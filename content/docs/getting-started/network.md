> On the **first connection, connect Reachy 2 to your network using an ethernet cable**. You will then be able to choose another network using the dashboard.

## Hard-wired connection

Use an **ethernet cable** to connect your robot to the network.  

The ethernet plug is available at position (b) on [Reachyâ€™s hardware interface]({{< ref "reachy2" >}}).  
The computer inside Reachy is configured to use DHCP. It should thus be directly accessible on your network.  

To easily find the IP address of the robot, read the little LCD screen plugged in the back of the robot. Wait for the IP address to appear, it may take a few minutes.  

> Every 10 seconds, the screen switches between WiFi and Ethernet information.  


## WiFi

After your first connection with an ethernet connection, simply use the **dashboard** to connect Reachy to WiFi.  


> **If you cannot use an ethernet connection for your first connection:**
