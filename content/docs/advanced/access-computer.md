There are several ways to connect to your robot.

## SSH connection
Using the robot's IP address (check [Find Reachy 2's IP]({{< ref "help/system/find-my-ip" >}}) if you don't know it), you can directly connect via ssh to Reachy 2's computer:

```python
ssh bedrock@<Reachy.2.IP.address>
```

> For example, with robot's IP being 192.168.1.42:
> ```python
> ssh bedrock@192.168.1.42
> ```

## Hard-wired connection

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable has to be plugged in port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.

We use `tio`for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
`apt install tio`

To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code> <br>Then reboot your computer for the new group to be effective." >}}

Once connected, open a terminal on your computer and run:
```python
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```
*Note that depending on the elements you connected to the robot, the port could be something else than ttyUSB0. Check other available serial ports with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`*

You are then connected to Reachy 2 computer!

## Avahi connection

Find the serial number of your robot on its back, connect your computer on the same network as your robot, open a terminal and type:
```bash
ping <robot.serial.number>.local
```

>For example, if the serial number is reachy2-beta1:
>```bash
>ping <reachy2-beta1>.local
>```
